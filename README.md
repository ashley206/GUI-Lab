#Credits, Inspiration, Alternatives

Credits to the group that aided in brainstorming together for possible GUI Project ideas: 
Coryna Johnson
Ryan Williams
Jared Smith
Joseph Maurer

Inspiration came from thinking of simplistic applications that could still be useful as well as fulfill the requirements necessary for the project. Many ideas were given at the brainstorming session, and this one appeared the most interesting. The goal is to make the core of the application invigorating and useful, but also help extend knowledge of the Qt framework to gain the most from the project.
